# Capabilities, Limitations & Scope

What this skill can and cannot do, and where the boundary between **DBML-the-language** and the surrounding packages/tools lies. No syntax here — this is the inventory and the scope line.

---

## Supported tasks

| Task | Handled by | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Generate DBML (write valid `.dbml`) | ✅ | `syntax/language.md`, `syntax/relationships.md`, `syntax/advanced.md` |
| Explain DBML (read/interpret a schema, status of a construct) | ✅ | `syntax/reference.md`, this file (scope) |
| Review a schema for quality/validity | ✅ | `design/review.md` |
| Fix DBML (parse errors, modeling mistakes) | ✅ | `troubleshooting/`, `design/review.md` |
| Convert SQL → DBML (DDL file or live DB) | ✅ | `conversion/sql-import.md` |
| Convert DBML → SQL (export) | ✅ | `conversion/sql-export.md` |
| Assess round-trip / fidelity / losses | ✅ | `conversion/fidelity.md` |
| Improve schema design (naming, indexes, normalization) | ✅ | `design/` |
| Explain relationships & cardinality | ✅ | `syntax/relationships.md`, `design/normalization.md` |
| Explain limitations & best practices | ✅ | this file, `design/best-practices.md` |

## Unsupported tasks / out of scope

| Task | Why | Where it actually lives |
|---|---|---|
| Render an ERD / export PDF/PNG/SVG | DBML has no renderer — it produces a model, not an image | **dbdiagram.io / dbdocs.io** |
| Canvas layout / table x-y positions / z-order | No `.dbml` text representation | dbdiagram/dbdocs (Tool-only) |
| Install drivers / manage DB credentials / tune connections | Operational, not schema-authoring | `@dbml/connector` operator docs |
| Parse/parser internals (lexer, ANTLR `.g4`, binding-power) | Implementation detail, not behavior | `@dbml/parse` source |

When a request falls out of scope, **state the boundary** (below) rather than guessing.

## Scope boundaries — what belongs to what

> The #1 rule: **never conflate DBML-the-language with the packages or the rendering tools.** Each capability has exactly one owner.

| Component | Is | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **DBML** (the language) | a database-agnostic DSL spec | the syntax — exactly what `@dbml/parse` accepts (tables, refs, enums, indexes, notes, records, project, checks, diagram views, module system) |
| **`@dbml/parse`** | low-level parser engine | the `Compiler`; ANTLR grammars (dbmlv2 + 5 SQL dialects); `CompileError`/`CompileErrorCode`; multifile/`Filepath`; schemaJson types |
| **`@dbml/core`** | user-facing library | the `Database` model; `Parser`, `importer`, `exporter`/`ModelExporter`; transforms |
| **`@dbml/cli`** | command-line tool | `dbml2sql`, `sql2dbml`, `db2dbml` (→ `conversion/`) |
| **`@dbml/connector`** | live-DB introspection | `connector.fetchSchemaJson` for **6 dialects** incl. BigQuery |
| **dbdiagram.io** | online renderer | interactive ERD, sharing, **PDF/PNG/SVG export**, canvas layout |
| **dbdocs.io** | docs app | documentation generation/publishing/sharing |

### Renderer-only vs DBML-language
Anything with **no `.dbml` text representation** is **Tool-only** (dbdiagram/dbdocs), NOT DBML:

| Capability | Owner |
|---|---|
| Canvas x/y positions, per-view geometry, z-order, "synced" runtime state | dbdiagram/dbdocs (Tool-only) |
| Image/PDF/PNG export | dbdiagram/dbdocs (Tool-only) |
| `DiagramView` *filter* (which entities are visible) | **DBML** — but stores no geometry |
| `headercolor` / group `color` / ref `color` | **DBML** syntax (parses) — visual meaning is renderer-applied |

`Project.database_type` is stored by the parser generically; its **rendering dialect semantics** are applied by dbdiagram/dbdocs exporters.

---

## Limitations (DBML itself)

- **Single schema level only** — `schema.table`; nested `a.b.c` is unsupported (non-fatal `UNSUPPORTED`).
- **No type validation or mapping** — types are opaque strings carried verbatim.
- **No language-level `VIEW`s / procedures / triggers / sequences** — they're silently dropped on SQL import; document them with notes.
- **`<>` many-to-many synthesizes a junction table on SQL export** — only use it if you accept the auto-generated table.
- **Comments (`//`, `/* */`) are trivia** — not stored, not exported; use `note:`/`Note:` for persistent docs.
- **SQL is a strict subset of DBML** — round-tripping through SQL loses all enrichment (→ `conversion/fidelity.md`).

## Conversion support matrix

| Direction | Support |
|---|---|
| DDL-file import (SQL→DBML) | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Snowflake, Oracle (**no BigQuery**) |
| Live-DB import (`@dbml/connector`) | + **BigQuery** (6 total) |
| DBML→SQL export | `{dbml, mysql, postgres, json, mssql, oracle}` (**no Snowflake**) |

## Assumptions

- **Format:** always use the **`dbmlv2`** format key; `'dbml'` is the deprecated PEG parser.
- **Versions:** npm packages at `8.x`, engine self-described as "parser v2"; "DBML 3.0" is a community label for the modern construct set, not a parsed literal.
- **Exit codes:** `dbml2sql` **always exits 0** — never gate CI on it.
- **Verification:** every `.dbml` example is parser-validated; `examples/conversion/*.dbml` are real importer outputs.
