# Silent-loss walkthrough (`lossy_postgres.sql` → `lossy_imported.dbml`)

The input defines **4 objects**. The importer produces a DBML file with **1 table** and emits **no errors**. Here is exactly what happened to each.

| Input object | In output? | What happened |
|---|---|---|
| `CREATE TABLE accounts (…)` | ✅ survived | the table + its plain columns come through |
| `email_lower text GENERATED ALWAYS AS (lower(email)) STORED` | ⚠️ partial | the column survives as `email_lower text` — the **`GENERATED` expression `lower(email)` is lost** (no DBML representation for generated columns) |
| `CREATE VIEW active_accounts …` | ❌ dropped | views have no DBML construct → silently absent |
| `CREATE SEQUENCE accounts_seq …` | ❌ dropped | sequences have no DBML construct → silently absent |
| `CREATE FUNCTION audit() …` | ❌ dropped | functions have no DBML construct → silently absent |

## Why this matters
The importer **never warns** about dropped objects. If you import a 200-object schema and get a 150-object DBML file, nothing tells you the 50 are missing — you must **diff the object counts** yourself. Common silent drops: views, materialized views, sequences, triggers, stored procedures/functions, most `ALTER TABLE` sub-commands, generated-column expressions, MySQL `UNSIGNED`, Snowflake `CHECK`/secondary indexes.
